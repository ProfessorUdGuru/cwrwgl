The River Teifi, West Wales
The two men are John Davies (forefront) and Will Davies of Cenarth; the last two 
legitimate coracle fishermen in Cenarth.
They are both using the single-arm method of propulsion; a means of gliding 
downstream in a controlled way. They carry their coracles and their fish home on 
their backs. (1972)
