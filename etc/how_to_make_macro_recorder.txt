How to create a macro recorder that will save each and every keystroke, like the one in MS WORD, and save the saved keystroke in a database, and it will allow user to assign it a hotkey to paste the saved data anywhere in e.g. text editor, emails, etc!

Hi,

you need a concept like a script-engine or a "undo-from-the-beginning"-like set of operations.

Create an Interface or a abstract base class defining the Action/Undo BaseType and the needed Methods (like creating an instance, setting properties/values, executing the action and cleanup).

Create a set of classes that will hold the data for *each* action. Create a list that holds all intstances of these classes. 

When interacting with the main-program in any relevant way, add the data from this action to the list, ie. a new instance of a class of your set of classes holding the data.

Create a pointer-variable that points to the current position in that list. Increment it on each action. decrement it on each undo-in-the-main-program

create a (set of) class/es that will do the single actions with the provided data from the lists entries, so every action can be done by the data you collect.

To run the macro, start at point 0 in the list and do every action up to the current pointer's position.

To paste the data to text, override ToString() in your actions, to save the macro to reload into your program, do binary serialization.

Use OOP-concepts deeply here. Think of using Patterns here.
