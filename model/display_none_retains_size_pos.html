  <h1>How to retain cursor position in hidden divs so that <br>when they are re-displayed,
    the cursor position or highlighting is retained.
  </h1>

  <h3>This is regarding `display: none` and that's what I mean below whenever
    I say a div is "hidden". I didn't look into what `visibility: hidden` does
    in this regard.
  </h3>
  <div id="recallHilited">
    Because `display:none` retains info about what it's hiding, you can highlight
    some of this text, hide the div, then show it again, and the highlighting
    will be preserved.<br>This works automatically without the `focus()` method. 
    In this example, if the `focus()` method is used in the other div to retain 
    its cursor position while it's hidden, <br>data won't be retained in this div
    since it will lose focus. So to see this one work, comment the `focus()`
    calls in the other one.
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div id="recallCursor" contenteditable>
    Similarly, in this editable div, you can place the cursor or caret anywhere
    in the text, hide the div, show it again, and the placement of the cursor
    will be preserved. <br>Unlike the previous (non-editable) div, this won't retain
    its cursor position while hidden unless (1) the `focus()` method is used , or
    (2) text is highlighted in the div before hiding. <br>If text is highlighted, the
    `focus()` call is not needed here either.
  </div>

  <div>
    Summary: either an editable or a non-editable div will retain highlighting
    while display is set to "none" if nothing steals focus from it while it's 
    hidden. Ordinary divs don't take focus unless <br>they contain highlighted text,
    so they don't retain cursor position information while hidden. But editable
    divs can be made to retain cursor position while hidden, without highlighting,
    <br>if focus() is used so that the editable div doesn't lose focus while hidden.
